# ReeseAEJones Github Pages Website

## Description

I'm creating this project to improve my skills with:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - General website development
  
This project is created only from scratch with no special IDEs or code generation tools, so there will probably be quite a lot of commits simply to test simple feaatures.

## Features

- A single, basic home page

## Todo

- Create a better home page
- Create a resume page
- Create a page to display some of my personal projects
- Improve the style of the pages
